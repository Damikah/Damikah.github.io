      <h2>Our Story</h2>

      <!--Information about Dorcas Grooming -->
      <p>
        It started when we welcomed our pets into our lives and fell in love with them, little furry ones! Dorcas Grooming was born to fill the gap between our busy daily life and the time-consuming commute to the animal salon or pet grooming shop for grooming services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mobile pet care services vehicle offers the same standards as any fixed grooming service. Our wide range of professional and eco-friendly products, experienced groomers, and welcoming team will leave your pet wanting more!
        Our mission is to get your furry friendâ€™s tail wagging as soon as they see our van! We aspire to become the number one mobile pet grooming service in the UAE. Dorcas Grooming was founded by 2 pet owners who are committed to taking the grooming experience to a whole new level.
        Our vision is to provide a pleasant experience for your fur babies, to break their fears of groomers (if any), and to return them soft as a cloud!
      </p>
      <p> We welcome you all!</p>
